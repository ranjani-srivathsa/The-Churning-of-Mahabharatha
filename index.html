      <p>
  <strong>The Mahabharata</strong>, hailed as the <em>Fifth Veda</em>, is not merely a story of kings and battles.
  It is a vast ocean of wisdom – filled with gems of <em>virtue, devotion, knowledge and life lessons</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Comprising over <strong>one lakh sacred slokas</strong>, this epic is a treasure trove of invaluable gems such as the
  <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, <em>Vishnu Sahasranama</em>, <em>Vidura Neeti</em>, <em>Yaksha Prashna</em>,
  <em>Sanat Sujatiya</em> and many more.
</p>

<p class="question">
  We know that Sage <strong>Ved Vyasa</strong>, also called <em>Krishna Dvaipayana</em>, composed this great epic.
  <br>
  <span>But how did this vast scripture become known to the world?</span>
</p>

<p class="narrative-start">
  Long ago, King <strong>Janamejaya</strong>, the son of Parikshit, performed a grand
  <em>Sarpa Yajna</em> (Snake Sacrifice) to destroy the serpent <strong>Takshaka</strong>,
  who had caused his father’s death.
  During the intervals of this sacrifice, Sage <strong>Vaishampayana</strong>, the disciple of Sage Vyasa,
  narrated the story of Bharata – the great Mahabharata –
  to the king and the assembled sages, in the very presence of <em>Sage Vyasa</em>.
</p>

<p class="scene-shift">
  Later, in the sacred forest of <strong>Naimisharanya</strong>, a congregation of sages led by
  <em>Rishi Shaunaka</em> were performing a 12-year-long <em>Sattra (Yajna)</em>
  for the welfare of the world.
</p>

<p>
  During this holy sacrifice, <strong>Suta Pauranika (Ugrasrava Sauti)</strong>,
  the son of Sage Romaharshana, arrived there.
  At the request of the sages, Suta narrated all that he had heard from
  Sage Vaishampayana during King Janamejaya’s sacrifice,
  thus bringing the Mahabharata to all humanity.
</p>

<p class="conclusion">
  It is from this sacred narration, passed through generations of sages,
  that we receive the Mahabharata as we know it today.
</p>

      <p class="highlight">
        This <strong>“Churning of Mahabharatha”</strong> series
        is a humble effort to bring forth some of the
        <em>lesser-known stories</em> from Vyasa’s Mahabharata,
        for readers who wish to see the epic
        <strong>beyond its familiar chapters</strong>.
